1.1 Both Ways
An awkward exit at a job interview.


TIM: Obviously I’d love to work for you, and I appreciate you taking the time to meet with me. I… I feel good about it. I hope I didn’t do too much talking.


INTERVIEWER: No, you were great.


TIM: [GIGGLES] I hope to hear from you soon.


INTERVIEWER: We’ll be in touch. Really nice meeting you. [EXTENDS HAND]


TIM: Nice to meet you as well.


INTERVIEWER: Okay. [TIM GETS UP TO OPEN DOOR, IT CLICKS] Oh, looks like you push.


TIM: Oh, it does both.


INTERVIEWER: What?


TIM: It does both. I was here yesterday, and it actually goes both ways.


INTERVIEWER: Oh, okay.


TIM: Okay, see you. [MENACING MUSIC, CREAKING AND GRINDING AS TIM BREAKS DOOR BY PULLING IT OPEN, TIM DROOLS] See? Hope to hear from you soon.

1.2 Has This Ever Happened To You
A very specific legal problem.


MITCH BRYANT: [IN AD] Have you been the victim of unfair treatment by a business or a corporation? Has this ever happened to you? You bought a house, it was not disclosed to you that there was a termite infestation in the walls and in the moldings, so you have to take it upon yourself to call your own termite extermination company, [KNOCKING ON DOOR] but when the guys show up, they immediately ask if they can use your bathroom, then for two hours, they take turns going in and out of there, taking huge mudpies and over-flushing? Then they go in there together, and you hear a bunch of scrounging around, and then you hear a bunch of yelling, and one of them is standing in the bathroom doorway shouting at you that his friend’s foot is stuck in the toilet, and he says “Help him! You’ve gotta help him!” And when you go in there to help him, he just pulls his foot out easily and laughs ‘cause his foot wasn’t stuck. It wasn’t stuck at all, he was just faking it. And then they get really serious and say, “It’s Turbo Time!” And they both start running around the house as fast as they can and jumping over the couches. But when you try and jump in they yell at you and they say, “You’re not part of the Turbo Team! Don’t run! You don’t run with us! We’re the ones who run! Until you’re part of this Turbo Team, walk… slowly!”
        So you go lay down to be by yourself and read your art books, but then the next day you went into the bathroom, and it looked like the hole in your toilet had shrunk. And you said, “How could that be? There’s no way they could have shrunk the toilet.” But then you saw in the trash a receipt from home depot for a toilet the exact same size as yours, but with a joke hole that’s just for farts! They replaced your real toilet with a fart toilet, and now you can’t take a dump in your own house ‘cause your toilet can’t suck ‘em down and you feel sick to your stomach! Has that ever happened to you?!
Call me right now, please.




1.3 Baby of the Year
Things get ugly at the "Baby of the Year" contest.


HOST: [SINGING] Who will be the Baby of the Year? Look at their rolls. Look at their folds. Look at their rummy, bummy tummies. Heads are round. Bellies are squishy. [HARD ROCK STYLE] Look at their toes, like so many curled canned shrimp. [BACK TO NORMAL SINGING] Are they ticklish? Are they jigglish? Can they be tricked? Can they be chucked? Which one will move? Which ones will talk? But more importantly - which ones can dance? Oh. Who will be the Baby of the Year?


[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]


Welcome back. It’s been a grueling three months, but we’ve narrowed it down to three chubby little babies.


[APPLAUSE]


From Salisbury, North Carolina, Michael Patrick Porkins.


[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]


From Luverne, North Dakota, little Taffy Lee Fubbins.


[APPLAUSE]


And the bad boy of the competition, Bart Harley Jarvis.


[HARD ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
[AUDIENCE BOOING]


AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Fuck you, Harley Jarvis!


[BOOING]


AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Fuck you, Harley Jarvis!


HOST: Get her out! Goddamn it! [CLEARS THROAT] Judges, do you need any more information to help with your decision?


KIM: I have firmly made up my mind.


JENNIFER: I would like more information.


GREG: I’m a wreck right now.


HOST: I understand. This is a hard decision. Let’s hear once again from the babies’ pediatrician.


[APPLAUSE]


DR. SKULL: Baby Porkins is 99th percentile in weight and 10th percentile in height.


HOST: [GIGGLES] We got a certified chode on our hands. Little tuna can.


DR. SKULL: Baby Fubbins is also 90th percentile in weight.


HOST: Ooh! Another chode.


DR. SKULL: Mr. Jarvis is one of the most aggressive babies I’ve ever met.


[AUDIENCE BOOING]


DR. SKULL: He has a massive underbite and completely flat back of the head.


AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: I hope you fucking die, Harley Jarvis!


HOST: Get. Him. Out of here!


DR. SKULL: I’m honestly done. I don’t want to read anymore.


HOST: Yeah. Don’t let it ruin your day, okay? You’re still a great doctor. All right, judges, do you need more time?


KIM: It’s Porkins by a mile. [APPLAUSE] The button nose, the apple cheeks. He’s the best baby.


JENNIFER: If Taffy Lee Fubbins isn’t the Best Baby of the Year, I’ll kill myself on live TV.


KIM: Stop saying that!


GREG: All right, that...that’s it. I have to get this off my chest. [READING] “Earlier today, when I was waiting to use the private bathroom, I witnessed Michael Patrick Porkins’ father performing oral on the mystery judge of the competition. I’ve been conflicted about whether to say anything, because I feel like Michael Patrick Porkins Could win it without the oral. His father didn’t need to do the oral. And that is why it is so tough for me to tell about the oral.”


HOST: Oh, man that’s a bummer. Might fuck this whole thing up. While the judges make their decision, let’s watch our In Memoriam segment.


GREG: Oh, no.


HOST: Calm down, they’re old ones. They don’t stay babies forever, idiot. Fucking stupid asshole.


[GENTLE ACOUSTIC MUSIC PLAYING]


IN MEMORIAM: Little Denny Doo Dinkins, 92, respiratory failure. Shirley Cratsworth Shane, 78, car crash.


KIM: In Memoriams don’t usually include how they died.


HOST: Shut up.


IN MEMORIAM: Little Jeffy Jeremy, 96, throat slashed.


KIM: God...


[GLASS SHATTERS. WOMAN SCREAMING]


HOST: Someone get her! She’s trying to get Jarvis!
All right, you know what? This is dumb. Dump it. Trash it. This one’s garbage.


IN MEMORIAM: Tiny Dinky Daffy, 92, pancaked by drunk dump truck driver.

[CAMERA CLICKS]


WOMAN #1: Let me see it. Oh, yeah, that’s good. That’s great.


WOMAN #2: Thank you.


BRENDA: Thank you. Is it cute?


WOMAN #1: Yeah, so cute.


WOMAN #2: Send it to me.


BRENDA: Me too.


WOMAN #1: Yeah, okay. Sending now. Okay. Look what I just posted. “Brunch with these two dumdums.”


WOMAN #2: Oh, my gosh, so good. Is this good? I said “Sunday funday with these idiots.”


WOMAN #1: Yeah, that’s good. That’s great. So cute.


BRENDA: So cute. Okay, okay, so cute. Look what I just posted. “Eating crap with these sacks of shit. If they died tomorrow, no one would shed a tear.” So cute?


WOMAN #1: Wait, what the hell?


BRENDA: Well, you called me a dumdum, and she called me an idiot, so…


WOMAN #2: Yeah, when you post a pic of yourself where you look really cute, you have to say something a little self-deprecating so it doesn’t look like you’re just bragging.


BRENDA: Oh, okay! Got it. Sorry.


WOMAN #1: Yeah.


BRENDA: Alright, this is good.


WOMAN #1: Okay.


BRENDA: “Slapping down some pig shit with these fat fucks, and I’m the fattest of them all. If I died tomorrow, no one would shed a tear. Load my fricking lard carcass into the mud. No coffin, please, just wet, wet mud. Bae.”


WOMAN #1: Jesus, Brenda…


BRENDA: You called me a dumdum.


WOMAN #1: Right, it’s like a term of endearment.


BRENDA: Okay. All right. I got you.


WOMAN #1: Okay.


BRENDA: Okay. “Gulping down some pig dicks with these bags of meat. Sunday funday with these pig dicks. Hope nobody gulps us.”


WOMAN #2: So are we the pig dicks or the bags of meat?


BRENDA: Let me try another. “Slurping down fish piss with these wet chodes. Total tuna cans. Put a bullet in their fucking brains and leave their wet bodies on the side of the road. Boo caught me sleeping.


WOMAN #1: You’re not sleeping.


BRENDA: Okay, let me try another one.


WOMAN #1: Okay,


BRENDA: “Sitting here with two bona fide pieces of hog shit-


WOMAN #1: No.


WOMAN #2: Basically the same thing.


BRENDA: -they’re mad because I won Best Hog at the hog shit snarfing contest, but I’m not mad, ‘cause we’re all loads of beef, sitting on the side of the highway, getting our butts sucked by flies.” I tagged you both in that.


WOMAN #1: Why?


BRENDA: Why are you guys bullying me?

1.5 Gift Receipt
A gift receipt causes stress.


JACOB: Alright, I’m gonna… Maybe I’ll go for this one?


WOMAN: Oh that could be a good one


JACOB: Is this, is this you?


WOMAN: Yeah.


JACOB: Oh my… this is perfect. [OVER SHOULDER] Babe, we were just talking about how we need a new salt and pepper shaker set. Remember this? [BACK TO WOMAN] Thank you. This is incredible.


WOMAN: Oh, I’m so glad you like it. But there’s a gift receipt in there in case you want to get something that’s…


JACOB: Won’t need it, ‘cause this is perfect. Thank you.


[THEY EMBRACE]


WOMAN: Happy birthday.


JACOB: Thank you.


LEV: That one’s mine. I forgot to put my name on it.


JACOB: Cool, alright.


[OPENS GIFT]


JACOB: Cool.


LEV: Yeah, it’s a wreath. The guy at the store said he had the same one. He said it works great.


JACOB: Thank you so much, Lev.


LEV: Yeah, there’s a gift receipt in there if you want to exchange it for something that’s more you.


JACOB: Okay, cool. Thanks.


LEV: But you like it.


JACOB: I like it, Lev.


LEV: Great. [PAUSE] Then give me back the receipt.


JACOB: What?


LEV: Prove it. You said you like it. Give me back the gift receipt. You don’t need it anymore.


WOMAN: Lev, he likes the gift.


JACOB: You know what, I’m just gonna put all this stuff together in the same pile over here, if that’s cool? Okay. Ooh! [GRABS ANOTHER GIFT] I think I know who this is from.


LEV: If you love it as much as you say you do and as much as you have been saying… then it shouldn’t be a problem if I take the receipt back.


JACOB: Okay. Yeah. [EXTENDS RECEIPT] Here you go. Jesus.


LEV: Glad you like it. Happy birthday.


JACOB: Thanks. Um, let… let me open… who…?


MELISSA: Oh, that one’s ours.


JACOB: Alright. [OPENS GIFT, LAUGHS] Are you serious? Firefighter pugs? Honey, we gotta go put this up on our fridge this is incredible!


MELISSA: We just thought it was cute.


LEV: And you’d be fine if I ate it?


JACOB: Huh?


LEV: The gift receipt. You’d be fine if I ate it?


JACOB: Why would you eat it?


LEV: You said you liked the gift. So you wouldn’t have any qualms if I ate the gift receipt and it didn’t exist anymore. Right, Rick? Right, Melissa?


JACOB: Uh… I don’t have any qualms. You can eat it if you like.


LEV: Awesome. Down the hatch, bon appetit.


[SLOWLY EATS RECEIPT. SHRUGS]


MELISSA: Should we open another gift?


JACOB: Ye… yes. [CHUCKLES] yes. Uh, okay, how about this one?


[GRABS ANOTHER GIFT]


JACOB: I think I know what’s in this one. [OPENS BOX, PICKS UP BOOK] Oh, whoa! Hey! I just heard an interview of this guy! This is so interesting, thank you!


LEV: I hate to do this, but I’m afraid our gracious host didn’t wipe properly.


JACOB: What are you talking about?


LEV: When you went to the bathroom earlier to do the mud pie… you must have used too small of a slice of toilet paper when you wiped, and you got mud pie on your hands, and then you touched the receipt, and then I ate the receipt, and now I’m sick off your mud pie.


JACOB: [UPSET] What the hell are you talking about? You’re probably sick because you ate paper, you fricking psycho.


LEV: [YELLING] No, I eat paper all the time! What I don’t like to make a habit of doing is eating mud pie!


JACOB: [YELLING] Why do you even eat paper?! That doesn’t even make sense!


WOMAN: Okay, you guys, calm down! This is insane! There’s a simple solution to this. Jacob hasn’t touched my gift receipt because he likes my gift. So we just have someone else eat my gift receipt and see if they get sick.


LEV: But it can’t be Jacob, ‘cause he’s gonna pretend he’s not sick even if it’s caked in pure shit.


MELISSA: I’ll do it. I’ll eat the receipt to solve the problem.


LEV: And Jacob doesn’t touch it!


WOMAN: That’s right. And if Melissa gets sick, then that means that paper makes you sick. But if Melissa doesn’t get sick, then that means Lev ate the mud pie.


JACOB: There is no mud pies, okay? And I genuinely like the gifts.


RICK: Swear to fucking god?


JACOB: Yes.


RICK: Then let my wife eat the fucking receipt.


[MURMURING FROM PARTY GUESTS]


JACOB: Oka… Okay.


MELISSA: [SPRAYING HANDS] I am now sanitizing my hands. I have not gone to the bathroom yet today. I took a shower last night after I took a piss and shit. Now… someone, hand me the receipt.


[JACOB REACHES FOR RECEIPT]


LEV: [IN HYSTERICS] Jacob, don’t you get anywhere near that!


[RICK HANDS MELISSA RECEIPT. MELISSA INHALES DEEPLY. EATS RECEIPT]


RICK: How you doing, honey?


MELISSA: I feel… [PAUSE] fine.


[PARTY GUESTS GASP COLLECTIVELY]


MELISSA: Paper doesn’t make you sick on its own. [POINTS AT JACOB] he used too small a piece.


JACOB: Lev’s probably not even sick! He’s probably faking it!


LEV: You son of a bitch! [GROANS IN PAIN]


RICK: Jacob was lying about the mud pie! And if he was lying about something as simple as grabbing too small a slice, that probably means he doesn’t like the gift either.


LEV: Exactly!


WOMAN: But you liked my gift, right, Jacob?


JACOB: Yes!


WOMAN: What about Rick and Melissa’s?


[PAUSE}


RICK: [YELLING] You piece of shit!


[RICK PUNCHES PILLOW OFF COUCH]


MELISSA: Rick!


RICK: Fuck! [PUTS HEAD IN HANDS]


LEV: Somebody call 911. Tell ‘em to send an ambulance…


JACOB: Oh my god…


LEV: Tell ‘em it's… the ugly house on Kenmore. The one where you can see the KFC sign through their front window.


[WOMAN 2 APPROACHES WITH A CAKE SINGING “HAPPY BIRTHDAY”]


WOMAN: No! Don’t let Jacob touch that!


[WOMAN SLAPS CAKE OUT OF WOMAN 2’S HANDS ONTO GROUND. PARTY GUESTS GASP]


RICK: Everybody, let’s get out of here. This place is covered head-to-toe in shit.


[FOOTSTEPS AUDIBLE AS EVERYONE LEAVES. JACOB SIGHS, PUTS HEAD IN HANDS]


LEV: All you had to do… was like the gift… and not have a big ol’ mud pie on the bottom of your butt. It’s not a big deal. You had a big mud pie, you had too small a slice, then I ate the mud pie, now my stomach’s absolutely fucked. [REACHES OVER TO TOUCH JACOB] Shouldn’t have had such a sloppy mud pie…


JACOB: Get off me, man.


LEV: Fine! [STANDS] Nobody likes your house anyway.


[MELANCHOLIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYS. LEV WALKS TO DOORWAY]


LEV: You should know, your wife kissed me on the cheek when I got here. Now look at you… all alone. Everybody’s going to party at my house. Happy birthday, Jacob.


[JACOB’S WIFE ENTERS]


JACOB: I just… I was just trying not to use a ton of paper towel.


JACOB’S WIFE: I just hope Lev’s alright.


[OUTSIDE HOUSE, CAMERA INSIDE CAR LOOKING OUT WINDOW]


WOMAN: Okay, you guys, I’ve got Lev in my car, so just follow us. [ENTERS DRIVERS SIDE] Lev, what’s your address?


[CAMERA ZOOMS OUT, REVEALS LEV DEAD IN PASSENGER SEAT. WOMAN SCREAMS]

A nifty new tug-friendly t-shirt.


WOMAN VO: River Mountain High is sponsored by TC Topps TC Tuggers Shirts, the only shirt with a tugging knob.


[SCHOOL BELL RINGS]


[INDISTINCT STUDENT CHATTER]


BRANDON: Hey. Am I seeing you tonight?


CLAIRE: I don't know, Brandon. I shouldn't even be talking to you.


BRANDON: What's going on with you? You've been avoiding me all week.


CLAIRE: You're hiding something. What happened that night with Riley?


BRANDON: Look, I told you, we got in a fight, and she stormed off. That was the last I saw of her.


CLAIRE: Then why did Tyler see her in your car at 2 A.M.?


BRANDON: Oh, God, Tyler! Tyler's a freak. Everybody knows that.


CLAIRE: He may be weird, but at least he didn't beat up Matt Simms in the locker room in front of everyone.


BRANDON: Okay. Look... you can't say anything, but–


PRINCIPAL S: All right, you two, get to class. The bell already rang, you can't be in the hall when the bell rang. The bell already rang.


BRANDON: Sorry, Principal S.


PRINCIPAL S: That's okay.


[PRINCIPAL S TUGS ON A LITTLE KNOB ON THE FRONT OF HIS SHIRT]


CLAIRE: That’s a cool shirt.


PRINCIPAL S: Yeah, it’s a TC Topp from TC Tuggers, the only shirt that’s got a little knob on the front so you can just pull it out when it gets trapped on your belly.


BRANDON: It’s very cool.


PRINCIPAL S: Yeah, I was doing this all the time—


[PRINCIPAL S TUGS ON HIS SHIRT WITHOUT USING THE KNOB]


PRINCIPAL S: and the wear and tear was wrecking all my regular shirts. But TC Tuggers has this little knob on the front so you don’t wreck your shirt, or hurt your hand.


BRANDON: Yeah, that makes sense.


PRINCIPAL S: (speaking very loudly) Yeah, you know what I mean? Because when you go through the day, your shirt gets kind of bunched up, so I was wrecking my shirts ‘cause I was pulling them out subconsciously, but this has that knob, so you can just do it easily.


CLAIRE: Awesome. Well, we’ll get to class.


PRINCIPAL S: But they’re not a joke.


CLAIRE: What?


PRINCIPAL S: You don’t make jokes about ‘em, TC Tuggers. You don’t wear ‘em as a joke, you don’t give ‘em as a joke gift, or wear them ironically, or do pub crawls in ‘em like the Snuggie. They’re not like the Snuggie.


CLAIRE: Do they come in other styles?


[PRINCIPAL S PAUSES, RAISES INDEX FINGER, AND TAKES A LONG, DESPERATE DRINK OF WATER]

CLAIRE: Do they come in other styles?


PRINCIPAL S: Not really. No, yeah, the style is just... Is just basically this.


CLAIRE: Well, thanks, Principal S.


PRINCIPAL S: Yeah. Yeah, thank you for asking about the shirt and thinking it's cool, TC Tuggers. Yeah, I gotta go. Bye, Brandon. Think about what I said about TC Tuggers. Bye, Claire.
